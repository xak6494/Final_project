# Final_project
This website was modled after the last company i worked for, Scenic Landscapes. I am still comtemplating wether to finish it and sell it to my old boss, in order to do that i wouold need to do the follwing.
First off its not moble repsonsive which isent a huge deal but still important, smart phones are used just as much if not more then computers.
Next would be the CSS and javascript, i would like it to be more interactive and visually appealing to give it  more off a polished and professional look.
Lastly i would like to add the content, items to be sold, plant pictures and prices, and a sections for fish/pong supplies.
I would also need to assign and restrict all the employee roles, and give administrative options for the couple who owns the store so they could make changes to all statuses.
